This is an [R Markdown](https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com__;!!DZ3fjg!4dnyv6PexlKXWypBLt5HfZJXfxt1St5ykPOqrkmChv3uoIJgWqZKIDz41D0elAC0oMGdk-xXk0vYl1TTrhH9rt3r$ ) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

swim advisory = was there one issued [Y/N]

each individual set baced on name have 108 rowes and 6 Columbussys.

trying to get rid of the outliers (-1000 & +1500) in the scatterplot to make a more acurate histogram but donno how will ask 7/8/2022 (tommorow)

WRITE AB IT:

the data above for each individualized beach tells me that half of the beaches surveyed in 2016 had a rise in E.Coli levels through out that summer, one beach had lower levels through out the summer and the rest either stay roughly the same and/ or stagnate between dangerously high levels and normal low levels. 


**What dates created the highest and lowest recording of E. Coli in the given beaches?**

make sure everything is a "hunch" no definitive answers.

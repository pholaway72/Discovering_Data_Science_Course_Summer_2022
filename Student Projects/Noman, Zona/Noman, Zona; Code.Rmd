## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com__;!!DZ3fjg!_MrODM1DAZz3VuOxa01PtBFLcvvghhVvwMepD2dS9hujWRZJjO_W8ybKJM7xw0ap4DM1GbQxclm6r3hmHEbfRNkEhMo$ >.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
Crimes <- read.csv("~/Downloads/Crimes_-_2001_to_Present.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r}
filter(Crimes, Year == "2016", Primary.Type == "HOMICIDE", Arrest == "true")
filter(Crimes, Year == "2016", Primary.Type == "HOMICIDE", Arrest == "false")
```


```{r}
filter(Crimes, Year == "2001", Arrest == "true", Domestic == "true", Primary.Type == "THEFT")
filter(Crimes, Year == "2022", Arrest == "true", Domestic == "true", Primary.Type == "THEFT")
```

```{r}
hist(Crimes$Year, border = "purple", col = "pink", main = "Crimes 2001-2022", xlab = "Year")
points(mean(Crimes$Year),col="blue",pch=19)
```


```{r}
hist(Crimes$Community.Area, border = "sienna", col = rainbow(100), main = "Crime rate in community area", 
     xlab = "Community Area")
```
```{r}
Crimes = Crimes %>% select(-c("X.Coordinate", "Y.Coordinate", "Updated.On", "Latitude", "Longitude", "Location",
                              "Historical.Wards.2003.2015","Community.Areas", "Census.Tracts", "Wards", "
                              Boundaries...ZIP.Codes", "Police.Districts", "Police.Beats"))
```


```{r}
filter(Crimes, Year == "2001", Arrest == "true", Domestic == "true", Primary.Type == "ROBBERY")
filter(Crimes, Year == "2022", Arrest == "true", Domestic == "true", Primary.Type == "ROBBERY")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

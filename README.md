# Discovering Data Science Summer 2022

Discovering Data Science is an introduction to topics that intersect between statistics, computation, and real-world applications. The course is administered through [Discovery Partners Institute](https://dpi.uillinois.edu/), a part of the University of Illinois system. This 5-week-long course is project-driven, giving students opportunities to analyze real-world datasets and discover the impact of the data. Throughout each experience, students reflect on the social issues surrounding data analysis such as privacy and design. The course was taught by [Paul C. Holaway](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-holaway/) and assisted by [Abhi Thanvi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhi-thanvi-2a1283173/) during the summer of 2022. All course materials created and used during the summer are included in this repository.

## Folders

- `Data Sets`: All data sets used for in-class examples and labs.
- `Documents`: This folder is where you find the [syllabus](https://github.com/pholaway72/Discovering_Data_Science_Course_Summer_2022/blob/main/Documents/Syllabus.pdf), [course calendar](https://github.com/pholaway72/Discovering_Data_Science_Course_Summer_2022/blob/main/Documents/DPI%20Su22%20Calendar.pdf), and [project guidelines](https://github.com/pholaway72/Discovering_Data_Science_Course_Summer_2022/blob/main/Documents/Project%20Guidelines%20and%20Rubric.pdf).
- `Labs`: Students were assessed during the summer using daily lab assignments (numbered 01-14). Each lab folder contains a blank `.Rmd` file for students to fill in and the solution `.Rmd` file and PDF.
- `Lecture Notes`: This folder contains the daily lecture notes (numbered 01-14). Each lecture folder contains a blank `.Rmd` file for students to fill in and the solution `.Rmd` file and PDF.
- `Pictures`: Any images used in lecture notes during the summer are here.
- `R Cheat Sheets`: Reference sheets for RStudio, R Markdown, and various `R` packages for students to use.
- `STAT440 Notes (Statistical Data Management)`: HTML notes from Dr. Christopher Kinson of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. These notes were used to help create coding examples and problems for students.
- `Student Projects`: These are the final projects turned in by the students participating in the course. Each folder contains a `.Rmd` file with the student's code and project report.
